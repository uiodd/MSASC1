 ## Document Description
 
- `\config\global_configs.py`: Different data sizes trained on three datasetsFor instance, to test on MOSI using the sizes:

ACOUSTIC_DIM = 74
VISUAL_DIM = 27
TEXT_DIM = 768

to test on MOSEI using the sizes:

ACOUSTIC_DIM = 74
VISUAL_DIM = 35
TEXT_DIM = 768

to test on DAIC-WOZ using the sizes:

ACOUSTIC_DIM = 39  
VISUAL_DIM = 49    
TEXT_DIM = 768
