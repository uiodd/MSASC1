 ## Document Description
 
- `\config\global_configs.py`: Different data sizes trained on three datasets. For instance, to test on MOSI using the sizes:

ACOUSTIC_DIM = 74

VISUAL_DIM = 27

TEXT_DIM = 768

to test on MOSEI using the sizes:

ACOUSTIC_DIM = 74

VISUAL_DIM = 35

TEXT_DIM = 768

to test on DAIC-WOZ using the sizes:

ACOUSTIC_DIM = 39  
VISUAL_DIM = 49    
TEXT_DIM = 768
